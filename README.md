Execution of round robin algorithm.

P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 are processes.

The application is in portuguese.

The button "reiniciar" is the same that "restart".

"Time quantum" is the max time that a process may to use the CPU.

"Processo 1 usando a CPU..." is the same that "Process 1 using CPU...".

Each circle's value is the time for the process to complete its task.

When circle's border is red means that the process Pn is using the CPU.

The execution is clockwise.
